	|lex.yy.c       |an expr lexical analyzer (scanner) generated by flex                        |
	|expr.c         |a expr analyzer which includes main() function and a manually coded getsym()|
	|expr.in        |a simple expression test file                                               |


2. Building an expr analyzer by calling a lexer generated by Flex \
   ```$ make exprlex```

3. Building an expr analyzer by calling the lexer mannually coded in expr.c. \
   ```$ make expr```

4. **pl0** will be needed for compilation. You can download [here](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yuzhang/compiler/2012s/pl0.zip).

Note: we use a macro LEXERGEN to control which getsym() (in above 2 or 3) is called. If LEXERGEN is defined, the generated lexer is called, otherwise the manually coded getsym() in expr.c is called.
